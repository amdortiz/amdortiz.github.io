 <td style="text-align:justify">My research focuses on the interactions between global biodiversity, agriculture, and trade. Our research focus on how these relationships affect food security. Our research will also address how these interactions will be affected by climate change. <a href="http://biota-ucl.org", target="_blank">Read more about the BIOTA project.</a><br>

BIOTA is a NERC funded project and a collaboration between the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources and the Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research.


<h2>Biography</h2>
I am an interdisciplinary researcher who focuses on food security and climate change.<br>

I worked on the assessment of the projected impacts of climate change on wheat production with a multi-method approach at the University of Sheffield Department of Geography and Animal and Plant Sciences. <br>I was funded by the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment as the flagship PhD Cohort of the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures. <br>

Prior to my PhD, I worked in the Philippines at the Ateneo de Manila University School of Government and the Manila Observatory, where I conducted research on risk and resilience to natural hazards such as tropical cyclones.<br>

In 2012 I finished my dual-MSc degree in Environmental Science from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU) and the University of Copenhagen, where my Masters research was on the impacts of climate change on banana production. <br>

My Bachelor of Science degree was completed at the University of Oregon (BSc Biology, minor in Comparative Literature and Chemistry). I have worked as a naturalist intern with the Audubon Centre in the United States. <br>
